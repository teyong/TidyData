TidyData
========
This repo contains an R script that cleans out the data collected by UCI about Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones. The 2 data sets are results from the script. The script takes raw data, combine the training and testing data in to one data frame. The data is then joined with the activity table. The script subsets data that are asked for and melt it to tidy data form where one row is one observation and one column is one variable.
